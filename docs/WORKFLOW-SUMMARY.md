# ✅ Updated Workflow Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Direct Trigger Connection**
- Removed deduplication nodes (Check if Already Processed, Is New File?)
- Google Drive trigger now connects directly to Download Audio
- Simpler, faster workflow execution

### 2. **Automatic Content Chunking for Notion**
- Added "Build Notion Blocks" code node
- Automatically splits long content into 2000-character chunks
- Both AI summary and transcript are chunked if they exceed 2000 chars
- Each chunk becomes a separate paragraph block in Notion

**How Chunking Works:**
```
If AI Summary is 5000 characters:
→ Block 1: First 2000 chars
→ Block 2: Next 2000 chars
→ Block 3: Last 1000 chars

If Transcript is 3500 characters:
→ Block 1: First 2000 chars
→ Block 2: Last 1500 chars
```

### 3. **Notion API Integration**
- Replaced n8n Notion node with direct HTTP Request to Notion API
- Supports dynamic block arrays (required for chunking)
- Uses environment variables: `NOTION_API_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`

### 4. **File Cleanup**
**Removed:**
- ❌ FRESH-START-COMPLETE.md (outdated)
- ❌ CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md (no longer needed)
- ❌ REFACTORED-POLLING-ARCHITECTURE.md (implemented)
- ❌ GOOGLE-DRIVE-BACKUP-FEATURE.md (implemented)
- ❌ DEDUPLICATION-AND-LOOKBACK.md (feature removed per request)
- ❌ test_recording_processor.py (unused)
- ❌ test-google-drive-webhook.py (not using webhooks)
- ❌ test-local-webhook.py (not using webhooks)

**Kept:**
- ✅ README.md (main documentation)
- ✅ test-complete-pipeline.py (API reference)
- ✅ iwatcher-gdrive-trigger.json (workflow definition)
- ✅ import-workflow.py (deployment script)
- ✅ assign-credentials.py (credential management)

## Current Workflow

**ID:** `U3vmnuxEDb92tc8m`
**Status:** ✅ Active
**Trigger:** Google Drive "New Folder" (checks every minute)

### Flow:
```
1. New File in Google Drive (trigger - from "New" folder)
   ↓
2. Download Audio
   ↓
3. Upload to AssemblyAI
   ↓
4. Start Transcription (with speaker labels)
   ↓
5. Initialize Polling (saves file_id from trigger)
   ↓
6. Wait 30 Seconds → Get Result → Check Status
   ↓ (loops until complete or timeout)
7. Process with OpenAI (speaker-aware)
   ↓
8. Prepare Data (format transcript with speaker/timestamps)
   ↓
9. Create Text File Content (passes through file_id)
   ↓
   ├─ Path 1 (Google Drive):
   │  10a. Convert to Binary
   │  11a. Save Text to Google Drive
   │  12a. Restore File ID (from Create Text File Content)
   │  13a. Move to Completed (moves original audio file)
   │
   └─ Path 2 (Notion):
      10b. Build Notion Blocks (chunking logic)
      11b. Save to Notion (via API)
```

**Note:** Both paths run in parallel. "Move to Completed" moves the ORIGINAL audio file from "New" folder to "Completed" folder using the file_id saved at step 5.

## Notion Output Format

### Page Title:
```
{filename} - {YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}
```

### Page Content:
```
Confidence: 82% | Duration: 11m 1s

## AI Summary
[Chunk 1: up to 2000 chars]
[Chunk 2: up to 2000 chars]
...

## Transcript with Speakers
[00:15] Speaker A: text here
[00:42] Speaker B: response here
...
[Chunked if > 2000 chars per block]
```

## Google Drive Text File Format

**Filename:** `{original_filename}_transcript.txt`

**Content:**
```markdown
# Recording_with_max.mp3 - 2025-10-05 19:34

## Metadata
- Confidence: 82%
- Duration: 11m 1s
- Processed: 2025-10-05 19:34:05

---

## AI Processed Summary

[Full OpenAI summary - no truncation, includes speaker attribution]

---

## Transcript with Speaker Diarization & Timestamps

[00:00] Speaker A: Hello, how are you?
[00:15] Speaker B: I'm doing great, thanks for asking!
[00:42] Speaker A: That's wonderful to hear...
```

**Note:** Only the speaker-annotated transcript is saved. No raw transcript.

## Key Features

✅ **Speaker Diarization** - Transcript includes speaker labels and timestamps
✅ **Smart Chunking** - Automatically handles content > 2000 chars in Notion
✅ **Google Drive Backup** - Complete content saved as .txt file (no limits)
✅ **Polling Loop** - Checks every 30 seconds, max 10 minutes
✅ **Error Handling** - Moves failed files to "Failed" folder
✅ **Direct Connection** - Trigger → Download (no deduplication overhead)

## Testing

Upload an audio file to Google Drive folder: `1G5yvNVNr3fATkXrHjkJz1VRa9HG8VE1k`

**Expected:**
1. File processed automatically
2. Full transcript saved to Google Drive
3. Chunked content saved to Notion (if > 2000 chars)
4. Original file moved to "Completed" folder

## Scripts

- **import-workflow.py** - Import/update workflow to n8n
- **assign-credentials.py** - Assign credentials to workflow nodes
- **test-complete-pipeline.py** - Test API integrations locally

All ready for testing! 🎉
